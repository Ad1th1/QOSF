Approach:
- We represent each integer in the list and the threshold value 'k' as binary strings.\
- We construct a quantum circuit to compare each integer with 'k' using quantum operations.\
- We perform measurements on the circuit to obtain the result.\
- The integers that are less than 'k' are extracted from the measurement results and returned.


This approach is valid for all kinds of numbers because it operates on their binary representations, which can be handled by quantum circuits uniformly.
